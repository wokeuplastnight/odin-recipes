        <h1>Spicy Korean Ribs</h1>
        <img src="../images/Spicy-Korean-Ribs.jpg" alt="Korean Ribs that tastes better with more sauce!">
        <h2>These spicy Korean ribs are a family favorite recipe, the more sauce, the better!</h2>
        <p>Pork ribs are slowly boiled and reduced in a savory blend of Korean spices - until the meat easily pulls off the bones. Absolutely one of my favorite ways to eat ribs! This is a perfect weekend dish to drop at the center of the dinner table. Simply pair it with a bowl of hot rice and some veggie banchans on the side. However, do expect a silent dinner... everyone will have their faces buried in the ribs hah!</p>

            <li>3 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 (1 1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, minced, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 (1 1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, sliced, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle pilsner-style lager</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons toasted white sesame seeds</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons toasted black sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove membrane from back of ribs or score with a sharp knife. Place ribs in a shallow dish and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Puree onion in a blender or food processor. Add kochujang, vinegar, garlic, sesame oil, soy sauce, and minced ginger; puree into a sauce. Rub 1/3 generously over ribs, reserving the rest of the sauce. Cover ribs with plastic wrap and refrigerate 5 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Scatter sliced ginger root over the bottom of a roasting pan. Place ribs meat-side down on top of ginger slices and pour lager over ribs. Cover with a lid or aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until meat is loosened from the ribs but not yet falling off the bone, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Let cool, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and lightly oil the grate. Place ribs on the grill and cook until browned, about 6 minutes per side. Coat with 1/2 the reserved sauce during the last 2 minutes of cooking each side. Garnish with white and black sesame seeds.</li>
        </ol>
