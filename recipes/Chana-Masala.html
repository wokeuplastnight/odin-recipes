        <h2>An exceptional homemade Indian recipe</h2>
        <p>Chana masala (also called chole masala) is a spicy north Indian dish of chickpeas in a tomato onion gravy that is best eaten with a naan, roti or rice. This delicious one pot chana masala recipe comes together in under 30 minutes. It is gluten-free, soy-free, nut-free and it can be oil-free.</p>
<!-- This is just a comment!-->
        <p>Chana masala is relatively low in carbs--a serving has a total of 15 grams of net carbs. It would work very well for someone that is eating a reasonably low carb diet--under 100 net carbs a day --but might be difficult to squeeze into a very restrictive keto diet that requires you to restrict yourself to 25-50 net carbs a day.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
